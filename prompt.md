This app is called alia. its a collection of aliases that point to URLs. There's a form at the top with 2 fields. 1 for the alias name. 1 for the URL (which is automatically set as the page the user is currently on). Below this form, is a list of all the users' aliases with options for editing or deleting them. There's also a search at the top for searching all your aliases.

The extension can be used in the browser location bar by pressing `q`, then `tab`. From there they just type their command, hit enter, and it sends them on their way.

There should be options to import/export aliases as JSON.
